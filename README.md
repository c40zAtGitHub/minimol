minimol is a mini-molecular viewer that is designed in a python friendly manner

It is (of course and expected to be) inferior to the product level molecular viewers such as GaussView, Avogadro, and VMD

HOWEVER, it is more friendly to developing an interactive program in python.

With the support of vispy, an OpenGL based library, it can take advantage of GPU to a certain extent.

For current version, minimol aims simply at being "usable"

To get minimol running, simply install vispy and run the sample_run.py
